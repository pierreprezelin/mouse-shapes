# MouseShapes

I often visit [eloshapes.com](https://www.eloshapes.com/), which is a gem of a website to compare various mouse shapes and find one that truly fits your grip. When I saw that it was made with Nuxt (as a Nuxt enjoyer myself that had to switch to React for work), I thought about (re)learning a bit by creating a simplified version to understand how it was made.

**Made with:**

- 💚 [Nuxt](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) - SSG, file-based routing, etc.
  
- ⚡️ [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) - Instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for lightning-fast development.

- 🌊 [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) - The instant on-demand atomic CSS engine.

- 🦾 [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - Type-safety for JavaScript.

- 💲 [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - The Open Source Firebase Alternative.

- 🏎 [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) - Zero-config cloud functions and deployments.
