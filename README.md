# MouseShapes

I often visit [eloshapes.com](https://www.eloshapes.com/), which is a gem of a website to compare various mouse shapes and find one that truly fits your grip. When I saw that it was made with Nuxt (as a Nuxt enjoyer myself that had to switch to React for work), I thought about (re)learning a bit by creating a simplified version to understand how it was made.

**Made with:**

- 💚 [Nuxt](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) - SSG, file-based routing, etc.

- 🌊 [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/) - Styles with [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss), a11y with [Reka UI](https://reka-ui.com/) and type-safety with [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

- 🚀 [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) but faster

- 💲 [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - The Open Source Firebase Alternative.

- 🏎 [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) · Easy hosting and deployments.
